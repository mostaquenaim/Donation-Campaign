        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>The Donation Tracker is a web application that helps you keep track of your donations. Here are some key features:</p>
        <h3>1. Navbar</h3>
        <p>The navbar at the top of every page includes a website logo and menu items for Home, Donation, and Statistics. The active route is highlighted for easy navigation.</p>
        <h3>2. Banner Section</h3>
        <p>The banner section features a title and a search bar. It has a captivating background image with an overlay. The overlay covers only the banner section, creating an aesthetically pleasing design.</p>
        <h3>3. JSON Data</h3>
        <p>The application uses JSON data containing information about donations. Each donation includes a picture, title, category, colors for backgrounds, description, and price.</p>
        <h3>4. Home Page</h3>
        <p>The home page displays a grid of donation cards, with each row containing four cards. Cards are customized with different background colors and text styles based on the JSON data.</p>
        <h3>5. Donation Details Page</h3>
        <p>Clicking on a donation card redirects the user to the Donation Details page. Here, users can view details of the donation, including the picture, title, description, and a Donate button. The button's background color matches the card's text color.</p>
        <h3>6. Donation Page</h3>
        <p>The Donation page lists all the donations made. Each row contains two cards with details such as picture, category, title, price, and a View Details button. A "See All" button appears when there are more than four donations, revealing the remaining data when clicked.</p>
        <h3>7. Statistics Page</h3>
        <p>The Statistics page features a pie chart that visually represents donations against total donations. The percentage is calculated and displayed on the chart, following the design from Figma.</p>
        <h3>8. Functional Search</h3>
        <p>The search bar allows users to search for donations by category, providing a seamless way to filter and find specific donations.</p>
        <h3>9. 404 Route</h3>
